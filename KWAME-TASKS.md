## Weekly Recurring Tasks — ~2-3 hours/week

### Sales Calls (1-2 hours/week)

When a prospect replies positively and books a meeting, you take the call.

**I provide:**
- Prospect research brief (who they are, what they need)
- Talking points and value proposition
- Pricing recommendation
- Proposal draft ready to send after the call

**You do:**
- Show up on the call (15-30 min each)
- Build rapport, understand their needs
- Present the service
- Close or follow up

**Expected volume:**
- Month 1: 0-2 calls/week
- Month 2: 2-4 calls/week
- Month 3+: 3-5 calls/week

### Review Dashboard (15 min/week)

Every Friday, I send you a weekly report on Discord. Glance at it:
- Are we hitting targets?
- Any red flags I flagged?
- Approve/reject my recommendations

### Approve Escalations (15 min/week)

Occasionally I'll ping you on Discord for:
- Ambiguous replies that need human judgment
- New niche or strategy recommendations
- Tool upgrades that cost money
- Angry prospects (rare)

Just reply with your decision. I execute.
